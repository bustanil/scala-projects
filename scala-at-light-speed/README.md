# Welcome

This is the code that was written when I learned the basic of Scala from [Scala at Light Speed](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmtsMNDRU0BxryRX4wiwrTZ661xcp6VPM) video by Daniel.

The course taught the basic but probably the most used features of Scala, so that you can start writing programs using Scala.

Here are the features that are explained in the course:

1. [Basic Scala](https://github.com/bustanil/scala-projects/blob/master/scala-at-light-speed/src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Basics.scala)
2. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/bustanil/scala-projects/blob/master/scala-at-light-speed/src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/ObjectOrientation.scala)
3. [Functional Programming](https://github.com/bustanil/scala-projects/blob/master/scala-at-light-speed/src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/FunctionalProgramming.scala)
4. [Pattern Matching](https://github.com/bustanil/scala-projects/blob/master/scala-at-light-speed/src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/PatternMatching.scala)
5. [Advanced Scala](https://github.com/bustanil/scala-projects/blob/master/scala-at-light-speed/src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/Advanced.scala)
6. [Contextual Abstraction (Scala 3)](https://github.com/bustanil/scala-projects/blob/master/scala-at-light-speed/src/main/scala/com/rockthejvm/ContextualAbstraction.scala)

Considering Scala is a "big" language, Daniel has done very well to compress the important concepts into this course. 
Of course this is just an "intro" to the language, one must learn more to gain depth of each feature explained in the course.
But I'm pretty sure it has shown how beautiful Scala language is, especially if you're coming from Java.
